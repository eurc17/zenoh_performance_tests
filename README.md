# Zenoh Performance Tests

This is a repository that contains the codes to test the performance of [Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/).  
Currently (2022/03/14), the Zenoh version tested is 0.6.0-dev, rev="1b71ef9345629682e9eae125bd4a95c55794afe5".

We use [psrecord](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord) to record the CPU and memory usage of the test program.

## Build

To build the program, please make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed.

Run the following command to build release version:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

If you need to parse the log file generated by [psrecord](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord), please build the `usage-parser` crate with the following command:
```bash
cd usage-parser
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Make sure you have build all the programs.

To run the test, simply run:
This command will run the test with default configuration. 
```bash
./target/release/zenoh_performance_test
```

For how to configure the test, please use the following command:
```bash
./target/release/zenoh_performance_test -h
```

To parse the log file generated by [psrecord](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord), run:
```bash
./target/release/usage-parser -i <path to log file>
```

If the current `task_worker_1` function cannot fulfill your tests or the CLI input lacks the parameters you need, feel free to create a new async function or add members in the `Cli` structure. 
Please do not modify the `main` function.

## Development

For people who are running experiment testings with this program. You may store the psrecord generated files under the `experiment-results` folder which is ignored in `.gitignore` file.

## Issues

If you encountered the situation that the program didn't terminate, please interrupt it and reduce the number of messages sent or the number of peers created.
